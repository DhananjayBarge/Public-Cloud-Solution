# Public-Cloud-Solution
As per the Assessment I came up with 2 solution/proposals. I have marked them as proposal-1 and Proposal-2 for there required Code and Architecture design.
Code_Proposal-1 contains bunch of json templates. For deploying the code from this proposal please use azuredeploy.json template where the same template can be used with parameters.json file whihc i have created for each environment (Test, Acceptance, Production). User the respective environment parameter file with azuredeploy.json template.
